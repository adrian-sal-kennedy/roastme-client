# Good for all kinds of stuff.
## Herby chickeny tomatoey winey goodness.

### I am in no doubt that this is not an authentic Italian recipe.

This is the first recipe I really learned how to make. Mum has a way of shoving me out of the way whenever I tried to cook anything in her kitchen, so I was in my twenties before I had a chance to brave such things alone.

I was house sitting in Nhulunbuy, about 6000km from mum's kitchen so there was no chance of being overruled. I had the recipe and that was it.

Dead simple. Keeps well in the fridge. Super tasty.

{"Prepare Ingredients": "Chop the onion finely, slice the mushrooms about 5mm", "Saute": "On a hottish large skillet, pour about 30ml oil and soften the onion in it", "Brown the chicken": "Add the chicken and sear it until it gives up some juice and browns a little.", "Simmer": "Add the mushrooms and let them soften. Add the tomatoes, bring the heat up then add wine. Allow to reach boiling point, then turn heat down to a simmer.", "Balance the flavours": "If the wine is particularly strong, add more tomato. If it's too wet, add balsamic in place of wine to achieve similar flavour", "Cook up some carbs": "after shimmering for maybe 40 mins, put on some pasta or rice, such that it will be ready when the chicken has been simmering for an hour", "Serve": "2kg chicken should serve 4 people easily"}
